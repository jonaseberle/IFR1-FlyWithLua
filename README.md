# Unofficial Octavi IFR-1 X-Plane/FlyWithLua Script
Supports IFR-1 on unsupported platforms. Tested on Linux.

## About
This project is built on https://github.com/acehoss/IFR1-FlyWithLua/tree/main
I am running on Linux, for which there is neither a plugin from Octavi nor a Mobiflight build.
The script made by acehoss made me dare buying the IFR-1. Many thanks to him!

This version covers two usages: "standard" aircraft and the AW109SP by X-Trident.

## Install
1. Install [FlyWithLua](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/38445-flywithlua-ng-next-generation-edition-for-x-plane-11-win-lin-mac/)
2. Download and copy `octavi-ifr-1.lua` into FlyWithLua's `Scripts` directory.


## Usage (common word)
The script attempts to open the IFR-1 on load and periodically rechecks. It should automatically connect or reconnect if the IFR-1 is not plugged on start or if it is unplugged and replugged.

## Usage (standard)
This "standard" mode is highly based on the standard functions offered by Octavi.

On COM1, COM2, NAV1, and NAV2, pressing the knob button will activate shift mode. The LEDs will all light up to indicate shift mode. Shift mode generally makes the knob adjust the value printed in blue above the mode button, but there are some bonus hidden features.
In normal (i.e. non-shift) mode, the LEDs display the active AP modes.

### COM1/HDG
Adjust the COM1 standby frequency. Press the swap button to swap to active.

In shift mode, the knob adjusts the heading bug. Pressing the OBS/HDG button will sync the vacuum-driven heading indicator to the compass heading.

### COM2/BARO
Adjust the COM2 standby frequency. Press the swap button to swap to active.

In shift mode, the knob adjusts the pilot's altimeter setting. Pressing the swap button latches to std.

### NAV1/CRS1
Adjust the NAV1 standby frequency. Press the swap button to swap to active.

In shift mode, adjusts the NAV1 OBS

### NAV2/CRS2
Adjust the NAV2 standby frequency. Press the swap button to swap to active.

In shift mode, adjusts the NAV2 OBS

### FMS1, FMS2
These are the main modes that are set up to be specific to aircraft with GNS430/530 navigators, as they use 430-specific X-Plane commands. In these modes, the bottom and right side buttons and the knobs (including clicking the knob for cursor) operate the navigators.

### AP
The LEDs indicate the AP status, and the bottom buttons select the AP mode. The little knob adjust altitude preselect, and the big knob adjusts vertical speed target.

VS to preselected ALT can be activate by pressing ALT while holding VS (press and hold VS, then press ALT while still holding VS, then release both)

### XPDR/MODE
Adjust the transponder code. The big knob adjusts the first two digits, and the little knob the last two.

In shift mode, the knob adjusts the transponder mode.

Pressing the AP/CDI activates IDENT on the transponder and the LED flashes when transmitting IDENT.


## Usage (AW109SP)
Only the basic functions are retained from the normal mode.
The LEDs display the active AP modes except in FMS1, FMS2 and when the shift mode is used.

### COM1/HDG
Normal mode: same as standard
No shift mode

### COM2/BARO
Normal mode: same as standard
In shift mode, the knob adjusts the pilot's altimeter setting.

### NAV1/CRS1
Normal mode: same as standard
No shift mode

### NAV2/CRS2
Normal mode: same as standard
No shift mode

### FMS1, FMS2
FMS1 = pilot PFD
FMS2 = pilot MFD
The right keys (direct to, MENU, CLR...) are binded to the EFIS right buttons (warning! this means that the names do not match, only the position does).
The four leftmost keys (AP, HDG, NAV...) are binded to the EFIS left buttons.
The fine knob controls the right knob.
The coarse knob controls the brightness (left knob).
Swap has no function.

### AP
General philosophy: to activate / deactivate a mode, do a long push.
The APR key is an exception: short push to activate / deactivate the APP mode, long push to activate / deactivate the GS mode. The LED displays the APP mode.

AP is replaced by the IAS as the AP stays ON all the time anyway.

To control an axis with the knob, do a short push (the LED will blink, named "hot" state in the code).
The fine / coarse will behave as expected, except for the VS where both have the same speed.

In "hot" state in the HDG or IAS mode, the knob replicates the one on the remote bug panel.
Pushing the knob pushes the one on the RBP. Pressing the frequency swap presses the LVAN / VNAV button.

When no axis is being controlled, the knob is used for the RHT. Pushing it activates / deactivates the RHT mode. Pushing the frequency swap activates / deactivates the hover mode.

### XPDR/MODE
The transponder is replaced by controls for the rightmost part of the RBP.
The coarse knob controls the left / right arrows, the frequency swap controls the "set" button.
The fine knob represents the knob itself. It can be pushed as well.


## Support
None.
